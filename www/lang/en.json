The map derived from the MODIS product MCD12Q2 shows global land cover dynamics of vegetation at 500 m spatial resolution. Red colors indicate a late start of the vegetation activity whereas green colors highlight an early start of the growing period in the year.",

Red colors indicate a decrease of the vegetation activity whereas green colors highlight increase of the vegetation activity between 2001 and 2014.",
